====================================================================================

The data set is based on the SAMSUNG dataset provided in the assignment instructions

====================================================================================

#Base features from SAMSUNG Dataset
(please read the Readme.txt from the original dataset for further details)

* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

As a result, we get a total of 66 measures per lines



# Contents of new Dataset

* Each record provides measures for one activity and one test subject
* EAch record contains the mean of the original features per activity/subject
