====================================================================================

The data set is based on the SAMSUNG dataset provided in the assignment instructions

====================================================================================

#Base features from SAMSUNG Dataset (please read the Readme.txt from the original dataset for further details)

*tBodyAcc-XYZ
*tGravityAcc-XYZ
*tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
*tBodyGyro-XYZ
*tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
*tBodyAccMag
*tGravityAccMag
*tBodyAccJerkMag
*tBodyGyroMag
*tBodyGyroJerkMag
*fBodyAcc-XYZ
*fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
*fBodyGyro-XYZ
*fBodyAccMag
*fBodyAccJerkMag
*fBodyGyroMag
*fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

As a result, we get a total of 66 measures per lines



# Contents of new Dataset

* Each record provides measures for one activity and one test subject
* EAch record contains the mean of the original features per activity/subject
